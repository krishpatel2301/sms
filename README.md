The purpose of this Python code is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based school management system that connects to a SQLite database. The system allows users to add, view, delete, and display student records.

The system uses the tkinter library to create the GUI interface, and the tkcalendar library for the DateEntry widget. The SQLite database stores student information such as the student's name, email address, phone number, gender, date of birth, and stream.

The functions in the code are responsible for various tasks such as retrieving and displaying all records from the database, adding a new record to the database, deleting a selected record from the database, viewing a selected record's information, and resetting the form to its default values.

The add_record() function retrieves the values entered in the form fields and adds a new record to the database. If any of the fields are empty, an error message is displayed to the user. If the record is added successfully, a success message is displayed, the form fields are reset, and the updated list of records is displayed.

The remove_record() function removes the selected record from the database and the Treeview widget. If no row is selected in the Treeview, an error message is displayed. If the record is deleted successfully, a success message is displayed, and the updated list of records is displayed.

The view_record() function displays the selected record's information in the form fields. If an invalid date format is found in the selected record, an error message is displayed. If the record is found and the date format is valid, the form fields are updated with the selected record's information.

Overall, the purpose of this Python code is to create a simple, user-friendly school management system that allows users to manage student records with ease.
